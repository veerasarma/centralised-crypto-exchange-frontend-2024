The safety measures We adopt include but are not limited to:<br />(1) Physical measures: Records containing Your personal data will be stored in a properly locked place.<br />(2) Electronic measures: Computer data containing Your personal information will be stored in computer systems and storage media that are subject to strict log-in restriction.<br />(3) Management measures: We have set up an internal safety defence department to protect the users&apos; information, established relevant internal control systems, and adopted the principle of strict authorization for our employees who may come into contact with Your information; therefore, only properly authorised employees are permitted to come into contact with Your personal information and such employees must comply with our internal confidentiality rules for personal data. Furthermore, we provide sustained training to our staff on relevant laws and regulations, privacy and safety guidelines, enhance publicity and education on safety awareness, and organise our relevant internal personnel to carry out emergency response training and emergency drills on a regular basis, so as to enable them to fully understand their job duties and emergency response strategies and procedures.<br />(4) Technical Measures: encryption technology such as Secure Socket Layer Encryption may be adopted to transfer Your personal data.<br />(5) Security Measures: In order to ensure Your information security, we are committed to using various currently available general security technologies and supporting management systems to minimise the risks that Your information may be disclosed, damaged, misused, accessed without authorization, disclosed without authorization or altered. For example, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software is used for encrypted transmission, encrypted information storage and strict restriction of data centre access. When transmitting and storing sensitive personal information (including personal biometric information), we will adopt security measures such as encryption, authority control, removal of identification marks, and de-sensitization, inter alia.<br />(6) Other measures: We regularly review our personal data collection, storage and processing procedures; furthermore, we limit the access of our employees and suppliers to Your data in accordance with the principle of &ldquo;as necessary&rdquo;, and our employees and suppliers must abide by strict contractual confidentiality obligations.<br />2. If You become aware of any security vulnerability of our Platform, please contact us promptly so that We can adopt appropriate actions as soon as possible.<br />3. Despite the above-mentioned technical and security measures, We cannot guarantee the absolute safety of data transmission on the Internet, so We cannot absolutely guarantee that the personal data You provide to us through our Platform are safe at all times.
